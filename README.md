## Compromises

1. For the user cards, I opted to forgo adding styling to the "See details" link to make it visually clear that it is in fact a link, in order to stay true to the "mock up" provided for the exercise. In a real world scenario, I would strongly encourage that this styling be kept in, or find a better compromise between the visual aesthetic and this a11y friendly styling.
